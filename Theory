Data Analysis
is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, drawing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.

**Key Activities:**
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing and describing the features of a dataset.
- **Data Cleaning:** Removing or correcting inaccuracies, duplicates, or irrelevant parts of the data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating data sets to find patterns, anomalies, and hypothesis testing.
- **Visualization:** Creating charts, graphs, and other visual representations to illustrate data findings.

**Objective:** The main objective is to understand the data, identify trends, and summarize the information.

Data Analytics
**Definition:** Data analytics refers to the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions about that information. It encompasses a broader scope that includes various forms of analysis and techniques.

**Key Activities:**
- **Predictive Analytics:** Using statistical models and machine learning techniques to predict future outcomes based on historical data.
- **Prescriptive Analytics:** Recommending actions you can take to affect desired outcomes using optimization and simulation algorithms.
- **Diagnostic Analytics:** Understanding why something happened by examining data more deeply.
- **Data Mining:** Discovering patterns in large datasets using database systems, machine learning, and statistical methods.

**Objective:** The goal is to derive actionable insights, make predictions, and inform strategic decisions.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND BUSINESS ANALYTICS

Key Differences

Objective:
BI: Focuses on "what happened" and "what is happening" using historical data.
BA: Focuses on "why it happened," "what will happen," and "what should we do about it" using statistical and predictive models.

Timeframe:
BI: Retrospective, analyzing past data.
BA: Forward-looking, using data to predict and prescribe future actions.

Data Analysis:
BI: Emphasizes data visualization and reporting.
BA: Emphasizes data modeling, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

Decision-Making:
BI: Supports tactical decision-making.
BA: Supports strategic decision-making.
