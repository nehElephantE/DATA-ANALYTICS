Data Analysis
is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, drawing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.

**Key Activities:**
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing and describing the features of a dataset.
- **Data Cleaning:** Removing or correcting inaccuracies, duplicates, or irrelevant parts of the data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating data sets to find patterns, anomalies, and hypothesis testing.
- **Visualization:** Creating charts, graphs, and other visual representations to illustrate data findings.

**Objective:** The main objective is to understand the data, identify trends, and summarize the information.

##############
Data Analytics
**Definition:** Data analytics refers to the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions about that information. It encompasses a broader scope that includes various forms of analysis and techniques.

**Key Activities:**
- **Predictive Analytics:** Using statistical models and machine learning techniques to predict future outcomes based on historical data.
- **Prescriptive Analytics:** Recommending actions you can take to affect desired outcomes using optimization and simulation algorithms.
- **Diagnostic Analytics:** Understanding why something happened by examining data more deeply.
- **Data Mining:** Discovering patterns in large datasets using database systems, machine learning, and statistical methods.

**Objective:** The goal is to derive actionable insights, make predictions, and inform strategic decisions.

DATA WAREHOUSING

->is a centralized repository that stores integrated data from multiple source systems.
-> It's designed specifically for analytics and reporting (OLAP - Online Analytical Processing), unlike operational databases that handle 
day-to-day transactions (OLTP - Online Transaction Processing).

. The Four Key Properties
Subject-Oriented
Organized around major subjects of the enterprise (Customers, Products, Sales)
Not organized around applications or functions
Example: "Customer" subject contains all customer-related data

Integrated
Data is consolidated from multiple, disparate sources
Inconsistencies are resolved (standardized formats, codes, etc.)
Single version of truth

Time-Variant
Data is stored with a time dimension
Historical data is maintained (years of history)
Enables trend analysis and historical reporting

Non-Volatile
Data is read-only once inserted
Updates happen through periodic loading, not real-time transactions
Stable environment for analysis


The Problem with Operational Systems:
Performance: Analytics queries slow down transaction systems
Data Silos: Data scattered across different systems
Inconsistent Data: Different formats, codes, and definitions
Complex Queries: Hard to write analytical queries on normalized schemas

The Solution - Data Warehouse:
Separation of Concerns: Analytics separated from transactions
Integrated View: Unified view of enterprise data
Optimized for Analytics: Schema and storage optimized for reporting
Historical Analysis: Maintains historical data for trends

└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘

A. Source Systems
Operational databases (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL)
CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot)
ERP systems (SAP, Oracle)
Flat files (CSV, Excel, JSON)
APIs and external data sources

B. Staging Area (Optional but Recommended)
Temporary storage for raw data from sources
Used for data cleaning and preparation
Usually not accessed by end users

C. Data Warehouse Core
Main repository of integrated, historical data
Uses dimensional modeling (Star/Snowflake schemas)
Contains detailed and aggregated data

D. Data Marts
Subset of data warehouse focused on specific business area
Examples: Sales Data Mart, Marketing Data Mart, Finance Data Mart
Can be dependent (from warehouse) or independent (direct from sources)

E. BI & Analytics Layer
Reporting tools (Tableau, Power BI, Looker)
Analytical applications
Data science and ML platforms


-> Data Modelling in Warehousing
A. Dimensional Modeling (Kimball Methodology)
The most popular approach for data warehousing:
Fact Tables
Contain business measurements (metrics, facts)
Usually numeric and additive
Examples: Sales amount, Quantity sold, Profit

B. Star Schema vs Snowflake Schema
Star Schema (Recommended for performance)
Fact table connected directly to dimension tables
Denormalized dimensions
Better query performance
     fact_sales
    /     |     \
dim_date  dim_customer  dim_product

Snowflake Schema
Normalized dimensions (tables split into multiple related tables)
Saves storage but more complex queries
Example: dim_product → dim_category → dim_department

     fact_sales
    /     |     \
dim_date  dim_customer  dim_product
                              |
                        dim_category
                              |
                        dim_department


-> Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs)
Type 0 - Retain Original: Never changes
Type 1 - Overwrite: Update existing record (loses history)
Type 2 - Add New Record: Insert new record with new surrogate key (preserves history)
Type 3 - Add New Column: Add columns for previous values (limited history)

-> Surrogate Keys
Artificially created primary keys (1, 2, 3, ...)
Independent of source system keys
Essential for handling SCD Type 2
Improve join performance

-> Granularity
The level of detail stored in fact tables
Examples:
Daily sales by product by store (high granularity)
Monthly sales by product category (low granularity)
Higher granularity = more flexibility but more storage

-> Conformed Dimensions
Dimensions shared across multiple data marts
Ensure consistency across the enterprise
Example: Date dimension used by Sales and Marketing data marts
